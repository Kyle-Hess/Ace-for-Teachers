            <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                Variables are the staple of many programming languages. They convey how we store our important data when we program.
                There are many different variants of variable types that hold information, for example: strings, integer & floats.
                Variable are given a name.
            </p>

            <h2>Strings</h2>
            <p>
                The first type of variable that we will go into detail about is the string. Strings can hold sentences, names, characters, letters, numbers and special characters. 
                Strings are very useful when communicating information from the program to the user of the program. They are less useful when storing information for the computer to use.
                To define a String variable, the data for the variable is wrapped around with quotation marks (“), followed by the line ending character.
            </br>
            </br>
                For example, in Java a name variable: String name = “John”;
            </br>	
                NOTE: All lines of code need to end with a line ending character, such as a semicolon

            </p>

            <h2>Integers</h2>
            <p>
            Integers store whole numbers, they can be positive, negative or zero. Examples of integers: -5, 8, 0, 2560. 
            Examples that are not integers: -3, -1.46, 3.14, 1 ½, .05 and 1,100.5.  Integers are useful for storing: age, year, etc. 
            </br>
            </br>
            Example: Integer age = “20”;
            or: Int age = “20;
            </p>

            <h2>Floats</h2>
            <p>
            Floats are variables with fractional numbers, meaning they store both whole and decimal numbers. 
            Example of float value: 2.50, -6.2, 3.1459, -150.42, 10. 
            Floats are useful for storing values such as: money values, height, etc.
            </br>
            </br>
            Example: float money = “2.50”;
            </p>

            <h2>Booleans</h2>
            <p>
            The Boolean expression has two data types are true or false, it is common to use booleans with control statements to determine the flow of a program.
            </br>
            </br>
            Example: bool  lightSwitch = true;
            or bool lightSwitch = false;
            </p>
